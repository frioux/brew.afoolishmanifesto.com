Review:  Hmm.. If you've had a welches white grape juice, you've had this wine.  Seriously, it was almost disturbing how much this tasted like grape juice and how little it tasted like wine.  So with that in mind, it might be a good introduction to wine if someone doesn't like wine, but otherwise it tastes like someone put everclear/vodka into some grape juice.  
Note:  The red version of this wine, is identical to the white version, just replace the white grape juice with normal grape juice.
