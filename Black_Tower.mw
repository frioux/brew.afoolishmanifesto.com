Review:  This was Becci's favorite wine last year, however, this years crop doesn't have the high level of flavor that last year did.  It has an intensly fruity flavor, and is very smooth.  The sweetness level is higher than the Relax but still not to the level of really sweet wines.  This wine goes particularly well as a desert or late night sipping wine.  It is easily good enough to enjoy without much else going on.  It tends to be a little sweet for most dinners, however, we found it complemented fetticini alfredo with gorgonzola peach and cranberry sauce very nicely.  

Score: (0-10)

Becci: 10 (last year) 9 (this years)

Goat: 8
