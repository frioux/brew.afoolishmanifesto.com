Currently this is my favorite drink of all, and hopefully with more and more practice (or perhaps one of these [[brutul.com]]) I will actually get a perfect pour.

The idea is that guinness is an excellent dark hearty chewy beer with all kinds of body, and a strongbow hard cider is a slightly sweet light hard cider, that when mixed realize the best of both worlds.  When it is pour correctly the cider and the beer are completely separated with the beer on top and the cider on bottom.  If you drink carefully you can keep them separate for nearly the entire drink.  However, mixing them also tastes delicious.  Hmmm... unfortuntatly they tend to be expensive, so... anyways, I thoroughly recommend them to all.   --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 17:26, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
