Review:  Both becci and I like this wine, however, this is a fruity sweet wine, to the degree that it's probably more of a desert wine then like a table wine.  Like most of the webers we've tried it is both tasty and relatively cheap.  I can emphasize enough that as white wines go, this one is really sweet.

Score: (0-10)
