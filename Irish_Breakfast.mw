Brewing notes:

This tea is pretty easy going as far as brewing is concerned.  I've brewed it anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes on first steep and not seen any bitterness resulting from either.  If you want to get a good second steep make sure to brew 3 minutes or so the first time and 5-6 on the second steep.

Review:

As a forward I have stopped drinking most of my tea with milk or sugar purely from a practical standpoint, at school I don't have easy access to either and so when I make tea or cofee in my office I usually do without.
That being said I find that this tea is never bitter, very smooth and has a nice full flavor.  It's not super duper special like golden monkey or anything but it is a really nice, relaxed easy going tea.  It has enough caffine punch to get me going in the morning if I havne't had coffee (usually need two cups though) and the flavor cuts through the morning taste malaise.  Finally, you can't argue with how cheap it is.  Overall, I recommend this tea highly.. great, cheap, tea.
