My dad bought one years ago to take camping, and it wasn't until recently that I remembered it. I was trying to figure out a way to make a good cup of coffee for just one person. I used to use a full size French press and only put in enough water for one cup, but that was really annoying. With my mokapot, I put in a bit of water, once scoop of coffee packed down, and set it on the stove. Within about three or four minutes most of the water has boiled through, so I turn the stove off. It's really convenient, because I can go off and do whatever, and as soon as I hear the steam hissing through I know it's about done (whereas with the French press, to make a good cup, you have to set timers and pay attention and complicated stuff like that). I always add a bit of room temperature water, mostly so I can drink it sooner and enjoy it longer. Some say that this produces espresso, but that's less than accurate, since there's more water than steam going through the grounds. It produces a small cup off coffee that is somewhere between a regular brewed cup and espresso. I find it to be nice and strong, with lots of flavor and no bitterness.
