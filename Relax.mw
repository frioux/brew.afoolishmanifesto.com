Review:  This wine straddles the line between a sweet white wine and a dry wine.  The flavor is strongly fruity, but not at an overpowering level.  It's not really quite a good enough wine to enjoy all by itself but especially while watching a movie or reading a book it provides a nice diversion.  Finally the alchol content is low enough that it doesn't feel breathy like some white wine tends to.

Score: (0-10)

Becci: 8

Goat: 6

Note:  We had this wine about 6 months ago, thus it is probably on a new year and may not be the same.
