Review:  This was a very different kind of wine, it was italian so that was new to us, it was very dry, which was kinda new, and it was just.. well wierd.  I'm not sure how to describe it, very dry, but very flavorful, acidic but not citrusy.  A very different experience.  I have a feeling that this is the kind of wine that people sit down and taste and talk about its attributes and make small  talk over, but it's not very good for drinking while reading your bible or eating dinner.  I would recommend this wine, but I would only recommend it to people who want to taste an interesting, different kind of wine, not like a good wine...
