Review:  This is one of the few red wines that both becci and I have really liked.  It wasn't particularly sweet, but it didn't feel like that really dry red wine that leaves your mouth feeling all pruny.  It is a table wine, and we found it did really go well with ravioli or whatever we ended up having with it.  Finally, I did use just a touch of it in my red pasta sauce and it added a nice bit of berry flavoring to it.  

Score: (0-10)
