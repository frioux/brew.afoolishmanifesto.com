Review:  This is a tremendous wine, in fact according to our local wine guru guys (they own the wine shop across the street) it was on wine spectators 100 best list for this year and it's easy to see why.  This wine is not particularly sweet, but its also not very dry. The flavor hits soon after taking a sip, and wow, very complex, very fruity, very awesome.  We don't often buy wines more than once, but this one is really killer.  I would certainly recommend it, and I'm sure we'll buy a few more bottles of this stuff this yera.  

Score: (0-10)
